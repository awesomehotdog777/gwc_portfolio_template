            <p>
                a website with a heavily blog-inspired interface! i made this for a program called the athena award. the "posts" are about topics that range
                all areas of my life, such as math, running, coding, and much more. it's also mobile friendly :)

            <a href="https://github.com/kimvurly/kimberly-s-gallery-of-stuff">kimberly's gallery of stuff</a>
            <p>
                this is another website with the same theme as the other website, but a gallery! when you click on the images, they flip over to reveal
                the stories behind each photo and why i decided to include them :) this one is NOT mobile friendly because i got lazy lol
